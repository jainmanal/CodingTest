# CodingTest
I have used the basic approach to create the UI for this application. 
As there was only one screen so the main code lies inside CodingTest/src/Screens/HomeScreen/index.tsx 
In the file i have imported firebase using react native library @react-native-firebase/firestore
I have used typescript to code the UI as per requirements
The data for quiz is coming from the firebase/firestore db.
There i have added 5 question on the basis of that i have used codition to check if the option clicked by user is correct or not.
